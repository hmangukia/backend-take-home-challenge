- POST `/shorten`
  - Accepts a long URL and returns a short slug-based URL and the slug. Format as follows:
  ```
    {
       "slug": "abcd123",
       "short_url": "http://your-service.com/abcd123"
    }
  ```
  - Reuses slug if the same URL is submitted again

- GET `/{slug}`
  - Redirects to the original long URL
  - Records visit timestamp corresponding to the URL

- GET `/stats`
  - Returns top number_of_links (default: 10), ordered by visit count (descending).
  ```
  [
    {
      "slug": "abcd12",
      "long_url": "https://www.example.com/...",
      "visits": 42,
      "last_visit": "2025-12-01T13:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "slug": "efgh34",
      "long_url": "https://www.example.com/other/long/url",
      "visits": 0,
      "last_visit": null
    }
  ]
  ```

- GET `/stats/{slug}`
  - Returns analytics of the slug specified
  ```
  {
    "slug": "abcd12",
    "long_url": "https://www.example.com/...",
    "visits": 42,
    "last_visit": "2025-12-01T13:00:00Z"

## ðŸš§ In Progress: Redis Caching
Redis-based caching is currently being implemented to optimize performance.
A [draft pull request](https://github.com/hmangukia/backend-take-home-challenge/pull/5) is open.

## ðŸš§ In Progress: AI flyer generation
As a fun side project and inspired by an idea I briefly discussed during my initial chat with Shardul, Iâ€™ve also started experimenting with AI-powered flyer generation. This part is not part of the original take home test, but something I wanted to explore independently.
